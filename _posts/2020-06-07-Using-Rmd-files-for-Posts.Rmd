Some blog posts will require the use of data and data-driven graphics to convey information, so it would be helpful to incorporate R in creating blog posts while adhering to the style of the website, e.g., font style, background, etc. I use [Jesse Cambon's blog post](https://jessecambon.github.io/2019/12/08/practical-tidy-evaluation.html) and the associated [Rmd file on GitHub](https://github.com/jessecambon/jessecambon.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2020-03-22-deploying-rmarkdown-online.Rmd) as a reference.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Sample Plot")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
