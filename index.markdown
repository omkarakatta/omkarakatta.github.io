I aspire to advance methodological scholarship in causal inference, microeconometrics, and machine learning
for greater understanding of the social sciences, particularly education, in conjunction with my interests in game theory, decision theory, and market design to the social sciences, particularly education.
<!-- My main interests in economics exist at the intersection of theory and application to include the subjects of microeconometrics, game theory, market design, and decision theory. I am also interested in applying my economics POV to the field of education. In particular, -->
<!-- I want to use decision theory and game theory to understand how and why students learn in order to structure incentives so they want to learn. I would like to evaluate (nonstandard) pedagogy and curriculum design with techniques from causal inference and microeconometrics in both observational and experimental settings. -->
