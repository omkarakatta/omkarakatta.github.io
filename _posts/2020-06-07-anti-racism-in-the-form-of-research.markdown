While the pandemic continues to rage, stories of police brutality and unfair racial prejudice rise to the surface. In response to the horrific and needless violence against black people, protests and riots have been taking place all over the nation in support of Black Lives Matter. With the time to reflect afforded by the lockdowns and the severity of the crimes committed against black Americans, I, like many others, are thinking about ways in which we can address racism.

As a brown man, I cannot truly understand the pain and struggle that so many black people are going through right now and have been going through for the past several centuries. The unbearable hurt and pain that I do feel makes me shudder at how excruciating it must be for the black community.

I acknowledge that I have been sitting on the sidelines. At times, I feel as though that as a person of color, I am a victim of racism, which puts me in the position of being helpless in fighting back. But I know that I only think this way to rationalize my passivity. While I am indeed a person of color, I am also a person of privilege, which means that any reason I have for being on the sidelines is an excuse that I say to make myself feel better for not being a part of the solution. In the recent weeks leading up to graduation, we have all been hearing words from older generations saying that as graduates, we now have the power and credibility to change the world for the better. It is our obligation to use the privilege of a Penn education to help humanity.

## What could I possibly do to help now?

I live in a generation that does not take the crimes against black people lightly, and they have inspired me to find the answer to this question. They are encouraging people to donate to organizations that advocate for black Americans and support those who protest against racism. They raise their voices in the form of peaceful marches, demanding petitions, and incisive critiques of the institutions to which they belong. They promote black literature and art to open our eyes to the injustice we have long-ignored. With caution, we can, should, and must take action now. The importance and urgency of these actions cannot be overstated.

A problem as systemic as racism seems to require a solution that is just as infrastructural. While the bursts of protests and donations raise awareness for those with power to change the infrastructure, I wonder: as someone who has no direct influence on infrastructure at the current moment, how can I complement these high-impact, short-term actions with sustained and persistent support of the black community?

## What can I continue to do to help in the future?

When I approach this question, I want to align my efforts to fight against racism with my long-term goals and vice versa. In my journey to ultimately become a professor at the forefront of education reform, I aim to advance the intellectual frontier. But how does this intellectual frontier help innocent people who are suffering at the hands of policy brutality or the innocent people who are facing the consequences of violent protest?

An obvious answer would be to use my training to study and uncover the mechanisms of racism, especially at a systemic level. In fact, one of the reasons I decided to pursue economics was that as a social science itself, economics positions me directly at the intersection of so many different sciences that directly study discrimination. Perhaps it is in my study of education reform that I highlight how despite being marketed as an equalizer or despite touting meritocratic ideals, our infrastructure disenfranchises marginalized students for reasons beyond their control and consequently favoring white cis males counterparts. No matter the field I decide to study, I promise to be deliberate in my research to study the problems facing black and marginalized communities. Coupled with my resolve to produce accurate and transparent research, I will produce knowledge that can help those who are finding and implementing solutions to the problems of systemic racism.

But delivering this promise is not enough. I can’t in good conscience sit in an ivory tower and pretend that simply by being a researcher, I will be a part of the solution. Otherwise, I would be extending the distanced support that I’ve done thus far in my life, which is not enough. I need to actively fight against racism and all forms of unjust discrimination while I am a professor. At best, suppose I arrive at research-based, data-driven, empirically and theoretically-proven, experimentally-tested solutions that will be effective when scaled. I might write a couple of papers to justify my proposals. But then what?

## Empathy within Research

In my limited experience as an economist, I recognize that the disciplines of academia can be insular. While the type of economics I want to pursue is all about people, not many people have the desire or the literacy to understand the research. So the only ones who might read and understand my work at the onset would be other economists. In fact, it seems as though most economists write solely for other economists. Of course, I do want other economists to read my work so that they can find flaws in my argument and offer constructive critiques so that I can polish my ideas. But beyond interacting with economists, I will need to create nontechnical summaries and tools to help my research be understood by a wide audience.


*How can I communicate with other social scientists?*
I need to learn their language. Appealing to the theme of empathy that resonates with the necessity of consuming black art and literature, I need to consume the research of other scientists. As a member of Penn, I have made friends from other disciplines and have access to a large network of researchers that I believe would be willing to talk with me about their field. I need to actively reach out and take advantage of this network so that I can immerse myself in the understanding of their field. I have already seen the benefits of using my economics POV in settings of social policy and philanthropy, but to provide a more illustrative example, I turn to my experience as a member of the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at Yale University. We were an academically diverse group of 12: 2 were economists, 7 studied applied natural sciences, and 3 were humanists. In reviewing our proposals, manuscripts, and presentations for the program, I gained some experience with the fields of my peers, and they were as interested to talk about their field as I was to listen. Relative to my experience as an economist, the humanists had a completely different approach to questions that economists pose as well, particularly questions about discrimination.
<!-- While I rely on quantitative data from observational studies and experiments and sometimes qualitative data in the form of surveys, these humanists rely on a different and broader set of evidence.  -->
I gained a deep admiration for the way in which humanists approach the challenge of finding, gaining access to, identifying biases in, and compiling the right sources in a meaningful way. Ultimately, engaging with their disciplines helped me further understand my own discipline, particularly its flaws. For example, nuanced information about the motives and cultures of people is not sought after in economics because such information cannot be represented in a matrix of $n$ observations with $k$ variables. Meanwhile, my humanist friends from Yale excelled in capturing this information. Their projects were very specific, often focusing on the lives of individual people, which allowed for a deep understanding of mindset. Unfortunately, this narrow view often reduces the external validity to other individuals and society as a whole. Thus, I posit that economists and humanists can work together to fill in the gaps within their own methodologies. More generally, all social scientists would likely benefit from removing the boundaries between disciplines.

<!-- and working with them can fill in the gaps of economic methodology. Similarly, the surge of big data and the expedience of data collection in economics can fill the gaps left behind in using anecdotal evidence.
  but simultaneously forgo the expedience necessary to collect widespread evidence, suggesting
expend a lot of effort to gain the same amount of data. -->


*How can I communicate with students?*
Education dispels ignorance that can otherwise sway impressionable minds to unfair and stubborn conclusions about the world, which is why it is important that students have the most up-to-date knowledge about the world. However, education does not always reflect the frontier of research, especially since the frontier of research becomes harder to reach as it becomes more advanced. I believe that actionable research should be made as accessible as possible, but often times, the crux of these messages are buried in the weeds of technicality that are only understood by scholars in the field. I wonder how many brilliant solutions to our problems have gone unnoticed because the authors were not able to convey the message or because people were not motivated, patient, or knowledge enough to pay them any attention.

As a (former) undergraduate and aspiring researcher, I am often intimidated by the volume of extant research and the prerequisites needed to fully understand the literature.
I am sure this feeling is not unique to me. Hence, even determined students who seek the most accurate knowledge are able to consume this information. Perhaps more dangerously, a passionate student might dare to read some papers but may unfortunately end up with a dangerous misconception about the field, replacing ignorance with falsehood.

Inspired by the work and delivery thereof of Opportunity Insights, the Center for the Economics of Human Development, and economists with blogs, I hope to provide nontechnical summaries and resources for students to whet their curiosity and become exposed to my research. Of course, without the technical details of the methodology, their understanding may not be as developed as a scholar in the field. However, making research that will help people make better decisions and lead better lives as accessible as possible is in our collective interest.

<!-- I have taken comfort in reading nontechnical summaries to whet my curiosity until I become more capable to understand the details, and in fact, these summaries and informal discussions have encouraged me to think more critically about the world. As an example, the presentations, nontechnical summaries, data excerpts, and interactive modules that Opportunity Insights publishes with each of its academic papers have helped me understand the influence of location on people's life outcomes. Unfortunately, such resources are in short supply. I believe these nontechnical summaries and resources tailored to students at various levels of understanding would help them make better decisions and lead better lives, which strengthens the positive externality that education provides. -->

<!-- As a researcher and educator, I would be in the ideal position to carefully select the details that are most relevant to the audience in question so that the message of the paper can be delivered. -->

In a more active way, I would also like to bring current research within the classroom and challenge the popular phrase: "beyond the scope of this class." Among the many benefits of this idea is that students get exposed sooner to what the frontier of research is like. The frontier will only move farther and if students cannot catch up to it, then they cannot contribute to it. Furthermore, by presenting current research, I can gain direct feedback from this audience on what confused them and on ways in which I can improve my delivery of information.
The trickiest part, especially after I will have graduated with a PhD, is to put myself in their shoes (an apt phrase that transcends this educational context) and think about what they already know.

<!-- The research frontier will only become more advanced and harder to reach if we don't   -->
<!-- On the other hand, students who are not so inclined to learn about the frontier may never want to contribute to it, especially since the frontier becomes harder to reach as it becomes more advanced. -->

<!-- One way I can actively think about how to present my work to this audience is to incorporate my research and my future colleagues’ research into my classes and lessons.

<!-- Work on this -->

*How can I communicate with policy makers?* This is perhaps the most important question because what we ultimately want to do is marry the frontier of research and the front lines of decision-making. Since I don’t have much experience working with policy makers, the following discussion is limited in its quality and scope of ideas because I don’t think writing nontechnical summaries of my research is enough. I need to learn more about this audience for me to provide a stronger answer. The best summaries are as effective as the degree to which they are correctly understood by the policy makers. But are policy makers interested in reading academic papers? How does research get into the hands of policy makers? Will writing papers intentionally for this audience be enough for this audience to read them? Or, do we need to change the way in which we disseminate information?

When thinking about the relationship between researchers and policy makers, I am reminded of the terrible incentive structures that are in place both in academia and in politics. As I mentioned above, my limited experience in academia lends me to believe that the disciplines in academia are quite insular. Even when some disciplines participate in the discourse of other disciplines, there stands the risk of miscommunication. Hence, the least resistant and more rewarding path is to have greater attention within the disciplines rather than between them. Meanwhile, politicians care about having a career. With the goal of being reelected, politicians have an incentive of sticking with policies that are marketed to be positive but are, in fact, negative because no one likes to highlight their failures during a campaign. I suppose that this is true of all of us: we don't like to give attention to our failures.
<!-- What are incentive structures of academicians? -->

But we must if we never want to repeat or exacerbate them. Our humanity demands us to take a critical look at ourselves to address the wrongs we have done to black Americans. This post is just a single step in my personal journey to confront these issues of injustice. I hope it will act as a reminder to deliberately focus on issues that matter, highlight failures and successes honestly, continually re-align incentives to ensure we are uplifting everyone’s interests and not just our own. Even still, this will likely not be enough. But it is the least I can do as an aspiring member of the research community.
